    <h1>Gotenberg Hyphens Test</h1>
    <p>
      Gotenberg is a powerful, open-source API designed to facilitate the
      conversion of various document formats into PDF files. Developed with
      simplicity and scalability in mind, Gotenberg is written in Go and is
      distributed as a Docker container, making it easy to deploy in a wide
      range of environments, from local development setups to large-scale
      production systems. Its primary function is to provide a reliable and
      efficient way to generate PDFs from HTML, Markdown, and Office documents
      such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key advantages of Gotenberg is its RESTful API, which allows
      developers to integrate document conversion capabilities into their
      applications with minimal effort. By sending HTTP requests to the
      Gotenberg server, users can submit documents for conversion, merge
      multiple files into a single PDF, and even apply custom settings such as
      page orientation, margins, and paper size. This flexibility makes
      Gotenberg an ideal solution for a variety of use cases, including
      automated report generation, invoice creation, and the production of
      certificates or other official documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gotenberg also emphasizes extensibility and performance. It leverages
      popular open-source tools under the hood, such as Chromium for rendering
      HTML and LibreOffice for handling Office documents, ensuring high-quality
      output and broad compatibility. The platform supports concurrent
      processing, allowing it to handle multiple conversion requests
      efficiently, which is particularly valuable in high-demand environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, Gotenberg is a robust and user-friendly tool for
      document-to-PDF conversion. Its open-source nature, ease of deployment,
      and comprehensive API make it a popular choice among developers and
      organizations seeking to automate and streamline their document workflows.
